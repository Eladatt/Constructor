Anesthesia Considerations:
- Induction: Propofol (2-3 mg/kg IV) or ketamine (4-5 mg/kg IM) for induction.
- Maintenance: Waterproof delivery system for inhalant anesthetics (isoflurane or sevoflurane).
- Physiological considerations: Dual-environment support (air and water), unique thermoregulation.
- Monitoring: Waterproof monitoring equipment for vital signs, especially oxygen saturation.
- Recovery: Provide a shallow water environment with supplemental oxygen.
- Special considerations: Scale-friendly positioning, careful electrolyte balance monitoring.
