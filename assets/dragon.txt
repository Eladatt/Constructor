Anesthesia Considerations:
- Induction: Alfaxalone (12 mg/kg) or propofol (10 mg/kg), similar to protocols for large reptiles.
- Physiological considerations: Three-chambered heart, temperature-dependent metabolism, periods of anaerobic metabolism.
- Monitoring: Heart rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation are crucial.
- Recovery: Monitor in a warmed, quiet environment for up to 24 hours due to potential for prolonged recovery.
- Special equipment: Heat-resistant monitoring devices and intubation equipment for long neck and potential fire breath.

Summary Table Row:
Dragon | Alfaxalone (12 mg/kg) or propofol (10 mg/kg) for induction | Three-chambered heart, temperature-dependent metabolism, anaerobic metabolism periods | Monitor in warmed environment for up to 24 hours, use heat-resistant equipment
